# Bingo

This repository contains code for generating office bingo cards. Nothing fancy in the code, UI design, or how you run it.

## Usage

Drag the `index.html` file to a browser window to generate a bingo card using the hard-coded sample list of office buzzwords. Reload the window to generate a different card.

## About

This was orginally created very quicky with buzzwords that were common in my office. Those have been replaced with some more general ones.
